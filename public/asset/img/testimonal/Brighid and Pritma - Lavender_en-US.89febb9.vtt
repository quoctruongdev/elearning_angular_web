My name is Brighid Gannon, and I co-founded
Lavender with my friend Pritma.

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.300
My name is Pritma Dhillon Chatta.

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.590
I'm the co-founder of Lavender, an online
psychiatry and therapy office.

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.660
I am a psychiatric nurse practitioner based
in New York City, and Pritma is based in

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:19.770
Calgary, Canada.

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:23.310
We were hearing from friends and family
that they really needed mental health

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.850
services and they weren't going to be able
to access those services in person anymore.

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.230
So we founded Lavender to make mental
health more accessible and affordable to

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.270
New Yorkers, especially during these times.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.950
Fiverr provided us the means and the speed
to really launch this quickly.

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:42.000
We used it for SEO, the logo, the website,
the copy.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.920
We used it for animated explainer videos
and custom illustrations, based on the

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.190
colors that our designer had chosen for us.

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.660
Literally, everything.

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:55.230
So it's one thing to start a business and
your website can be perfect and your social

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.320
media presence can be great, but people
need to find your business.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.870
So we realized very quickly that we needed
to work with an SEO specialist.

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.080
Mark, who helped us with our SEO, he lives
in Spain.

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:10.660
He sent us a video to summarize his
findings and what he had done for us so far.

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.440
It was really nice. It was like working
with a human right next to you, versus

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:15.370
being across the world.

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:17.410
It's been really, really exciting.

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:19.990
Our bookings are doubling every single
week.

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:21.940
More and more patients are finding us
online.

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.730
So I think our SEO is starting to work.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.780
And because we were able to launch so
quickly, we were first to market for this

00:01:27.781 --> 00:01:29.820
kind of online psychiatry and therapy group.

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.860
The one piece of advice I would give to
entrepreneurs who are shifting their

00:01:33.861 --> 00:01:39.020
business from offline to online, is to
really think outside the box.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.760
There's always a way, and we're proof of
it.
